# The birthday paradox :
When sitting with friends, sometimes we start our talk about out birthdays, 
the first thing that comes to our mind is that we won't have the same birthday,
the second thing that comes to our mind is that 'if the group was more than 366 persons,
then surely at least two persons has the same birthday (29 Fev excluded).

But, when diving into the probabilities, there is something surprising : 
"In a group of 23 persons, there is a 50 50 chance that at least two persons has the same birthday."

Seems unrealistic at first glance, but, it is somehow.
